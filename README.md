# calendar_giskard
There is my work I hope that you will like it. 
To start the application, clone the repository.
Then from the root launch
```
docker compose up
```
Then, the application will be available on **localhost:3000**

To create new availabilities, you will need a password.
*hint: It's very simple Gi\*\*\*rd*.

Every functionnality is present, you can add availabilities and delete them, you can have a visual look at the calendar. You can also add events with a visual list of every availability and delete them by clicking on them and add your email address.

For the stack, I used **nodejs** for the backend **mongodb** for the database.

For the frontend, I misscalculated the work, so I did plain html with **twig** templates.

I also used **bootstrap** to have quickly a nice looking visual.

I **dockerized** using the most recent image of mongo and node:18-alpine.
