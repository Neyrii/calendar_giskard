There is my work I hope that you will like it. 
To start the application, clone the repository.
Then from the root launch
```
docker compose up
```
r

To create new availabilities, you will need a password.
*hint: It's very simple G*****d*

For the stack, I used **nodejs** for the backend **mongodb** for the database.
For the frontend, I misscalculated the work, so I did plain html with **twig** templates.

If you have any questions, you can send me a mail at
